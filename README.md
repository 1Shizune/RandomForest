## Overview
We are developing a machine learning-based prediction model that identifies
whether a user is likely to have a sleep disorder, or not based on user-provided data such
as sleep patterns, lifestyle habits, and biometric information. At the core of the system is a
binary decision tree classifier trained on a real-world dataset of sleep-related health
attributes. We are oHering a personalized, data-driven sleep health assessment tool powered
by machine learning which will allow users to input details about their sleep habits,
lifestyle, and health, and instantly receive a prediction on whether they might have a sleep
disorder, without having to visit a doctor first. By identifying potential sleep disorders early,
users can seek medical intervention and adjust their lifestyle to improve their sleep quality
and overall health. Thus, users who want quick, private, and personalized answers to why
they’re feeling tired or unproductive but don’t know why, can now get them through our
product.
